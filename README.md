### `Implementation details`

I have utilised react-table to implement Q3<br/>
I have largely used redux for store management for all the project and assignments that i have implemented till date. However i have tried my hands on react hooks for the first time in this particular assignment.<br/><br/>

On click of Delete, the user entry will be deleted from the table.<br/>
On click of Open, a new tab is opened to display user details. In large applications with larger entries, opening in new window helps to retain the filters(if applied)<br/>
